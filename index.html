            <h1>Keep the ITU feeling - My key issue</h1>
            <h2>Christian Skovsgaard Rieck for Board of Directors at ITU</h2>
            <p>
              The ITU feeling is currently possible because our university is
              rather small. However, ITU expands regularly and it will create
              division and put the ITU feeling to test. I will fight to ensure
              great cohesion and collaboration between both students and staff,
              but also between study lines and departments.
            </p>
            <p>
              The students need a chance to understand the lecturers, and the
              lecturers need a chance to understand the students. We need ways
              to communicate face to face with each other, it could be at events
              where both staff/students feel welcomed, such as a calm Thursday
              bar. This encourages relaxed and comfortable talks to help improve
              the learning environment. Happy students and staff might also
              improve the already great research of ITU â€“ which could rank ITU
              higher.
            </p>
            <p>
              ITU is filled with students and there is an increased interest in
              the study life. This results in overcrowded areas - when trying to
              find a table to study or in line at ScrollBar to get a drink after
              a week's work. The well-being of students are one of my main
              concerns. There are many factors to take into account, the study-
              and social environment, but also the mental state of students. I
              will try to accomodate this problem in a way that takes the
              students' needs into account.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the proposal to create a new ITU campus in Vejle passes - then
              I will also fight to ensure that we keep the ITU feel no matter if
              you are located in Vejle or Copenhagen. This can be done with
              cross-campus activities to ensure we all feel welcome at both
              locations.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would love to explain or hear your ideas, so please reach out if
              you want a talk over a nice cup of coffee in Analog. You can find
              my contact information at the bottom of this page.

            <h1>Who am I</h1>
            <p class="margin-bottom">
              My name is Christian and I'm a student at ITU. I love to be busy
              and therefore I also actively seek new challenges. I have been a
              tutor for the new BSc students three years in a row. Moreover, I
              am also part of ScrollBar, where I currently sit on the board and
              control the finances. However, I am stepping down to focus on
              joining the board of directors. It is great to see how we as
              students try to thrive and how engaged we are to ensure we all
              feel welcome both through organizations but especially with the
              volunteering tutors/buddies. I love adventure and I try to seek
              new adventures as often as possible. This is also why I scuba dive
              and have taken several advanced courses through the years. If you
              know of a great adventure, hit me up!
            </p>
            <h1>What do I study</h1>
            <p class="margin-bottom">
              I study Computer Science in my first semester and I also did my
              bachelor's in software development at ITU. I am currently
              interested in picking the software engineering specialization
              since I enjoy being involved in decision-making and management.
            </p>

            <h1>Where do I work</h1>
            <p class="margin-bottom">
              I currently work at a fintech startup called Debbie. We automate
              and create software for a better debt collection process. We try
              to ensure customers/debtors get a good experience instead of a
              lawyer knocking on their door. It is interesting to be part of a
              startup since you get involved in many aspects of the business. I
              have also worked at cBrain, where I got just an important view of
              how bigger companies operate.
            </p>
            <h1>Other issues/causes</h1>
            <p>
              I would love to help keep ITU great by getting close to the
              long-term decision-making. Therefore, joining the board of
              directors is a perfect match to fulfill these goals. The Student
              Council is already trying to bring focus to mental health and
              well-being. I would love to bring that further up to the
              decision-making to ensure such an important issue gets the
              attention it needs. Moreover, I want to promote climate awareness
              at ITU to create a more sustainable environment at the university.
