            <h1>Keep the ITU feeling - Focus on well-being</h1>
            <h2>Christian Skovsgaard Rieck for Board of Directors at ITU</h2>
            <p>
              The ITU feeling is currently possible because our university is
              small. However, ITU expands regularly, creating division and
              putting the ITU feeling to the test. I will fight to ensure great
              cohesion and collaboration between students and staff and between
              study lines and departments.
            </p>
            <h2>A better ITU</h2>
            <p>
              The students need a chance to understand the lecturers, and the
              lecturers need a way to understand the students. We need ways to
              communicate face to face with each other. It could be at events
              where both staff/students feel welcomed, such as a calm Thursday
              bar. To encourage informal and comfortable talks to help improve
              the learning environment. Happy students and staff might also
              improve the already great research of ITU â€“ which could rank ITU
              higher.
            </p>
            <h2>Well-being of students</h2>
            <p>
              ITU is filled with students, and there is an increased interest in
              spending time at the campus. This results in overcrowded areas -
              when trying to find a table to study or in line at ScrollBar to
              get a drink after a week's work. This complicates many things for
              students. The well-being of students is one of my main concerns.
              There are many factors to consider, the study- and social
              environment, and the mental state of students. There is a lot of
              pressure on ITU students, which can be alleviated by using
              different methods, such as removing a portion of the considerable
              amounts of mandatory assignments, etc. The students need the
              possibility to extend their study period, which is not an easy
              process at ITU yet. We need to uphold the quality of education
              without compromising our well-being. I will try to accommodate
              this problem in a way that takes the students' needs into account
              - by bringing new ideas from the students' perspective to the ITU
              strategy.
            </p>
            <h2>Future expansions are not necessarily equal to a worse ITU</h2>
            <p>
              If the proposal to create a new ITU campus in Vejle passes, I will
              also fight to ensure that we keep the ITU feel whether you are
              located in Vejle or Copenhagen. This can be done with cross-campus
              activities to ensure we all feel welcome at both locations.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would love to explain my issues or hear your ideas, so please
              reach out if you want a talk over a nice cup of coffee in Analog.
              You can find my contact information at the bottom of this page.

              My name is Christian, and I'm a student at ITU. I love to be busy,
              and therefore I also actively seek new challenges. I have been a
              tutor for the new BSc students three years in a row. Moreover, I
              am also part of ScrollBar, where I currently sit on the board and
              control the finances. However, I am stepping down to focus on
              joining the board of directors. It is great to see how we as
              students strive to thrive and how engaged we are to ensure we all
              feel welcome both through organizations and especially with the
              volunteering tutors/buddies. I love adventure, and I try to seek
              new experiences as often as possible. This is also why I scuba
              dive and have taken several courses through the years. If you know
              of a great adventure, hit me up!

              for exams in the skyboxes late at night. I am currently interested
              in picking the software engineering specialization since I enjoy
              being involved in decision-making and management.

            <h1>Other causes</h1>
            <p>
              I would love to help keep ITU great by getting close to the
              long-term decision-making. Therefore, joining the board of
              directors is a perfect match to fulfill these goals. The Student
              Council is already trying to bring focus to mental health and
              well-being. I would love to bring that further up to the
              decision-making to ensure such an important issue gets the
              attention it needs. Moreover, I want to promote climate awareness
              at ITU to create a more sustainable environment at the university.
              I want to be proactive in tackling problems before they arise or
              while they are still latent. I believe this is key to improving
              ITU - however, we can not forget the already existing problems.
